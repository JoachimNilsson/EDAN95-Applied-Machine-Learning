# EDAN95 - Applied Machine Learning

My Lab-solutions in the LTH-course Applied Machine Learning.

Some topics and algorithms that were touched upon in the labs:

- k-Means clustering
- k-NN classifier
- Decision Trees
- ID3 algorithm
- Convolutional neural network (CNN)
- Recurrent neural network (RNN)
- Long short-term memory (LSTM)
- Word embeddings
- Naive Bayes classifier (NBC)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier (GNBC)
- Nearest centroid classifier (NCC)
- Expectationâ€“maximization algorithm (EM)
- Reinforcement learning (RL)
- Markov decision process (MDP)
- Monte Carlo method

Tools that were used:
